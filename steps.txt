NOTE : 
1) in props sometimes it happens that we want to pass props from object by one by one element 

post: {
  id: 1,
  title: 'My Journey with Vue'
}

we want to pass id and title as props and name of props which child component is excepting is also same we can do it like this (long way) 

<blog-post v-bind:id="post.id" v-bind:title="post.title"></blog-post>

or by donig this 

<blog-post v-bind="post"></blog-post>
 by this way vue will spreade all elements of object and it will give them to child
 so vue will translate ablove expression to longway by them self


 2) props are validated defore component instance is created so data, computed all will not be avalable in props
